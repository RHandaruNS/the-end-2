    <p>That's all.</p>

    <h2>Thursday, February 6th 2025</h2>
    <p>My friend indirectly told me to come to college today.
        I don't know if I'm either couldn't grasp what he was trying to say or am I just confused, but I decided to come.
        It was 12PM. There were like, 5 people. And then there's me. Wandering around.
        I don't even know why I'm in that room, they were dicussing about someone elses
        Division's report. I just felt out of place.</p>
    <p>That's all.</p>

    <h2>Friday, February 7th 2025</h2>
    <p>8 AM. Going to college. Organization purposes.
        Used my walking stick, it was cool.
        My friends wanted to try them. They're fun.
        I'm really bad at being a Departement Head, but quoting from myself:
        <i>I'm the only one who can.</i>

    <p>Anyway, my leg hurts (because I slipped and hurt my knee).
        That's why I brought a walking stick in my bag so if I
        fell and hurt myself, I could still stand up!
        While relaxing, I played a round of this mobile card game called <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balatro</a> and won.
        I shared it to a friend. It was my second win ever.
    </p>

    <p>2 PM. It was nice in the meeting. Quoting from a video game character,</p>
    <p>
    Being silent and surrounded by people you like is nice!
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll be useful alongside them someday.

        I forgot what happened on this day because
        right now the time of writing this entry is on February 17th 2025.
        I just forget about the days going foward.
        This blog will continue from a day that I remember. Isn't that fun?
    </p>
    <p>For compensation, here is a childhood game that I love.</p>

    <p>
        There was class this week. <i>Multiple</i>, even. The highlight of this
        day is Pak Wayan's class, Teknik Multimedia. Couldn't stop smiling the whole day LOL.
        I was paired with 4 other people (as per usual on his classes) for discussing a
        certain study case topic. We decided to discuss camera angles to take photos from.
        Eventually, we tried it on ourselfs.
    </p>

    <p>That's FARIS and myself. Me and VALENT took the photos.
    </p>
    <p>Oh hey, here's a video of AKBAR that VALENT took.</p>

    <p>This was also the day that we got this assignment! Pemrograman Web 1 by Pak Ravi.
        It was an interesting day because we got to use the new PC's in the computer lab.
        It's very similar to what was used in my high school.
    </p>
    <p>Oh yeah, there were cats.</p>

    <p>Overall, fun day!</p>
    <p>That's all.</p>

    <h2>Sunday, February 16th 2025</h2>
    <p>
        Came to <i>cooleg</i> at like 11PM, we were shooting the last scene for
        the cabinet's launching video. Standing there in the sun reminds me of
        ceremonies we used to do before college. BAROK, a member of my departement
        seemd like he couldn't stand the heat. I mean he looks <i>pissed</i>. At least his friends
        tried to cover him with the flags.
        <br>
        I have respect for my team, they seem to know what they're doing, which
        is awesome. One of them has a <b><u>drone</u></b>. Like, what????
        <br>
        Here's a photo of the cool-as-heck Media Team.
    </p>
    <img src="HAFIDZFANDI.jpg" alt="" title="HAFIDZ and FANDI directing the shoot.">
    <br>
    <p>
        After the shoot wrapped, I stayed for some reason and watched my friends play something
        called "Jendral"? I never played anything related to actual playing cards before,
        but FARIS teached me. It was nice.

    <h2>Monday, February 17th 2025</h2>
    <p>
        Today, I woke up at 5 AM. I do remember this day because it is the present time.
        The things that I did are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Morning routine.</li>
        <li>Hitch a ride with ARIFIN.</li>
        <li>First class, "Statistika".</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I enjoyed this one but I kinda dozed off at the end, still got it tho!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I bought a water bottle.</li>
        <li>There was no second class, so I bought some food.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Very delicious yes</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I bought another water bottle.</li>
        <li>Third class, "Pendidikan Kewarganegaraan."</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This class was fun, but my energy speaks otherwise.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>water bottle</li>
        <li>Last class of the day: "Bahasa Indonesia".</li>
        <ul>
            <li>It was fine.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Took some cloth to the tailor.</li>
        <li>Went home.</li>
        <li>Writing this very sentence.</li>
        <li>Finishing my "Pemrograman Web I" assignment</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I don't think this would even be an official "assignment" because
                he kinda just shrugged it off when everyone of us said that
                we couldn't finish it in 30 minutes.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <p>That's all for now. Thank you! Farewell.</p>
